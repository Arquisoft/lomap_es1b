| Entity | Input | Output
| User | The user interacts with the application via a computer or device, experiencing the frontend and sending requests to the backend. | The output is displayed in various parts of the system, covering almost all aspects.
| User Pod | This entity generates new PODs for users who haven't created them, updates POD information, and fulfills requests by providing the requested information. | It submits the data requested by the application.
| LoMap System | The user interacts with this system, sending requests through the interface. | It processes the incoming requests, manages the database to ensure consistency, and then displays the requested information to the user through the interface.

=== Technical Context

According to the SOLID project, shared information will be stored in each user's pod. In addition, we will implement the application using TypeScript together with React for Front-end development. Finally; we will make use of MongoDB, a NoSQL database system; and an endpoint using NodeJS with express.
